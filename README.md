# Etch-A-Sketch

## Description
Color in pixels with etch a sketch. Hover over grid with mouse pointer to color grid pixels blue, and change the accuracy of
the drawing by changing the size of the pixel grid. This project's algorithms are built with javascript, and most of the
display and user-interface are made with HTML and CSS. I formated it using flexbox for easier formatting, and this allows the program
to fit the number of pixels per grid line that the user asks for. The box-style for each box includes borders in the width and height
to that the program can accurately compute the width each pixel box should be before displaying on page. The width is calculated as a 
percentage, with the number of boxes per grid side adding to 100% of page width. Only the body is block style so the grid contents stay
in the width of a page. The program wipes the grid's container after accepting the user's new request, then displays the grid according
to the user's requested size.  


## Things I learned
The main objective of this application what to conbine my previous programming knowledge with a user-interface. Through this project
I learned how to use user input to display a grid on a page. I struggled a lot with variable scope in my previous project, and
I think it prepaired me for this.

## To Use
Please visit this project's link to go to this Etch A Sketch webpage. You can change the grid size with the orange button located in the top left.

## The Odin Project
I used the Odin project as a guide for this project.
